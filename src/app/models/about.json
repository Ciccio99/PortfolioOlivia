        "intro_text": "Hello! I'm Olivia Grace, an Indonesian interaction and visual designer. I'm on my last semester studying design at Rochester Institue of Technology. You can often find me glued to a monitor in the lab or taking naps on the couches.",
        "second_text": "After graduating high school, I traded the hot tropical weather, for a year supply of snow to study design at RIT. I am no stranger to dichotomes: boiling hot vs. freezing cold temperatures and of course third world vs. first world problems. From my experiences growing up in both countries, I want to design products that are both functional and inclusive.",
        "third_text": "If you're looking for designer who works hard and plays harder, or a girl who is shoe obsessed, or a buddy to watch Youtube videos of Casey Neistat and Jacksgap all day, don't hesitate to message me at <a href='mailto:oxg7534@rit.edu?Subject=Hello%20there!' target='_top'>chindograce.com</a>",
