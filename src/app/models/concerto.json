I wanted to solve the question: do these two features correlate with the revenue that artists gain from concerts? Concerto is a data visualization prototype that takes a look at the top 20 grossing concert tours of all time. We take a look at the \"ingredients\" of a tour and see what it takes to make a top grossing concert.",
